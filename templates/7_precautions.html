      <h2 style="color: white;">PREVENTIONS OF EYE DISEASE</h2>
      <p>
      <ol>
        Regular Eye Exams: Schedule comprehensive eye exams with an eye specialist (ophthalmologist or optometrist) to
        detect and address potential issues early on. These exams can identify problems like glaucoma, cataracts, or
        macular degeneration.<br>
      </ol>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Healthy Diet: Consume a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins (especially A, C, and E), minerals, and
        omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients can support eye health and reduce the risk of age-related conditions.<br>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Eye Protection: Wear appropriate eye protection when engaged in activities that pose risks, such as safety
        goggles in construction, sports goggles for sports activities, or sunglasses with UV protection when exposed to
        sunlight.<br>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Quit Smoking: Smoking is a risk factor for several eye diseases, including macular degeneration and cataracts.
        Quitting smoking can reduce these risks.<br>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        UV Protection: Shield your eyes from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays by wearing sunglasses that block 100% of UVA
        and UVB rays. Prolonged UV exposure can increase the risk of cataracts and other eye conditions.<br>
      </ol>


    </div>
    <div class="div0">
      <h2 style="color: white;">PRECAUTION OF EYE DISEASE</h2>

      <ol> Protective Eyewear: Wear appropriate eye protection when engaging in activities that can pose risks to your
        eyes, such as using power tools, playing sports, or working with chemicals. Safety goggles or glasses can
        prevent injuries. <br>
      </ol>
      <ol> UV Protection: Shield your eyes from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays by wearing sunglasses that provide 100%
        UVA and UVB protection. Prolonged UV exposure can increase the risk of cataracts and other eye conditions.<br>
      </ol>
      <ol> Eye Hygiene: Practice good eye hygiene by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your eyes with
        dirty hands, and following proper contact lens care and replacement guidelines to prevent eye infections.<br>
      </ol>
      <ol> Proper Screen Usage: When using digital screens for extended periods, follow the 20-20-20 rule (take a
        20-second break to look at something 20 feet away every 20 minutes). Adjust screen settings for optimal
        comfort and reduce screen brightness in dimly lit environments.<br>
      </ol>
      <ol> Balanced Diet: Consume a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, especially those high in antioxidants,
        vitamins (A, C, and E), and minerals like zinc and selenium. These nutrients support eye health and reduce the
        risk of age-related conditions.<br>
      </ol>
      <ol> Stay Hydrated: Drink enough water to prevent dry eye syndrome, which can result from dehydration. Proper
        hydration helps maintain the tear film on the surface of the eye.<br>
